Writing the report
******************

We will be compiling the following information into a Microsoft word report. It has been recommended we include screenshots in the report.

For now this is a temporary file that will serve as a starting point. 

Each segment has an official person assigned to it, but feel free and contribute to any segment you like in addition to your own.

Title page
==========

Assigned to Casey.

- identify the device and microcontroller platform your project used. 
- list all the team members names.

Something like...

	- Title page ----------------------------- 1
	- Table of contents ---------------------- 2
	- Introduction --------------------------- 3
	- The microcontroller platform ----------- 4
	- The test device ------------------------ 5
	- Development tools --------------------- 6
	- Your experiment ----------------------- 7
	- Conclusions -------------------------- 8
	- Contributions -------------------------- 9

Introduction
============

Assigned to Casey.

- describe the basic hardware components you chose to experiment with. 
- You should also describe the experiment you are going to conduct that demonstrates that hardware. 
- This section is not a detailed report on those components, just a basic introduction to the parts you ended up with, and the demonstration you decided to set up.

The Microcontroller Platform
============================

Assigned to Bryan.

- Describe the microcontroller board you are using. 
- This description should indicate where such boards can be obtained, and lay out the basic architecture of the board. 
- You can paste screen captures of diagrams from any documentation you find online. 
- You should describe the basic capabilities of the actual processor on the board. 
- Show a block diagram of the device indicating any special features you find that are interesting and useful in conducting your experiment.

The Test Device
===============

Assigned to Amanda.

- Describe the LCD and give an overview of what it might be used for. 
- Basically, describe what is involved in interacting with the device.
- Again, use screen captures of diagrams from documentation if you can.

Development tools
=================

Assigned to Evan.

- Detail the tools you needed to obtain to work with the microcontroller and the device. 
- You also need to identify any additional software you needed to interact with your test device.

Your Experiment
===============

Assigned to Evan.

- Describe the experiment you set up. 
- What led you to pick this particular experiment (hopefully it was not because it was easy!) 
- Be sure to show how your experiment was set up. 
- Show how the device is connected to the microcontroller.

Conclusions
===========

Assigned to Evan.

- What did you learn about hardware control from this project? 
- Did you get any ideas for other projects you might try in the future?

Contributions
=============

Assigned to Casey, but we may each want to write something for ourselves?
Include a summary of each team members contributions to the project.

i.e. ...

Amanda:	
		- The test device 
Evan:	
		- Development tools 
		- Your experiment
		- Conclusions

Project code
============

We all are working on this part.

- Include a listing of the code you used for this project.

Presenting your project
***********************

Our presentation may include our report projected onto the screen.

Submitting your report
**********************

We need to ask about this... each member has been asked to submit a copy of the report in their repos, but our repo is all together as a group...?
